Heavy rain, hailstorms destroy crops in north India

TNN | Mar 17, 2015, 06.38 AM IST
Unseasonal thundershowers and hailstorms left behind a trail of destruction, leveling standing crops across swathes of north India on Sunday, with the region still reeling under its effect on Monday even as Central authorities tried to assess the full extent of the cumulative losses.
Wheat, pulses, mustard, and gram took the brunt of sudden precipitation in east UP; Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra witnessed similar devastation. Landslides and snowfall led to the closure of the Jammu & Kashmir highway leaving thousands of people stranded.
UP farmers said they suffered crop losses of over 50% prompting chief minister Akhilesh Yadav to release Rs 200 crore from the state's emergency funds.
"Rains destroyed over 50% crops of wheat, mustard, pea and gram," lamented 75-year-old farmer Lalchand Patel of Jayapur village that was adopted by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi in May 2014.
The crop worst hit in UP was wheat, said farmers. More than 50% loss of its harvest is lost in eastern parts of the state, particularly Varanasi and surrounding districts of Jaunpur, Ballia. Jaiprakash Singh, a farmer of Tadiya village, said they've lost more than half their crops of arhar, mustard, peas and gram.
In Rajasthan, minister for disaster management and relief Gulab Chand Kataria said farmers in 28 of the state's 33 districts have been hit by the rains. The assembly suspended its business and focused on relief for affected farmers, allowing MLAs to visit their constituencies and assess the loss of human lives and livestock. The entire House donated one month's salary to the relief fund.
The Opposition Congress, seconded by some ruling BJP members, demanded the government declare the state calamity-hit. MLAs raised demands to waive loans, electricity bills and relax norms like minimum 50% crop damage to get compensation.
Rains lashed Punjab and Haryana as well dashing hopes of a bumper wheat crop with nearly-ripened harvest flattened completely at several places. Punjab farmers are already disturbed as the crop suffered damage when it rained heavily on March 2.
Farmers and experts are concerned about the leveling of standing crop. "Crops that have been flattened will get infected with fungus and wouldn't ripen," said Jalandhar agriculture development officer Naresh Gulati.
In Madhya Pradesh, authorities estimated 1,400 villages in 15 districts had suffered severe crop damage. Over 100 villages in Rewa division bore the fury of rains making it the most affected region, said the agriculture department.
Agriculture minister Gauri Shankar Bisen told TOI, "Our teams are surveying every district. Damage has been done to crops but its extent is still not clear. It will take at least 15 days to assess the situation."
J&K saw landslides in several places. "Rain and snowfall along the Jammu-Srinagar highway has forced us to stop traffic on the highway," SSP Traffic (Highway) Sanjay Kotwal said.
In Vidarbha region of Maharashtra, early reports by the agriculture department estimated that around 8,000 ha of farmland was hit by hailstorm in Nagpur and Amravati. This would be just a small portion of the total land under cultivation in the region, which is pegged at around 38 lakh hectares. This also the third time that Vidarbha has been hit by unseasonal rains this year. The impact was seen in isolated parts of Vidarbha and northwestern Madhya Pradesh.
